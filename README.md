This project runs the following static analysis and test tools on every commit:
- **AutoPep8**: Ensures code follows PEP 8 style guidelines.
- **Pyflakes**: Checks for coding errors, unused imports, and variables.
- **Pyright**: Static type checking for Python.
- **Pytest**: Ensures the correctness of the `mergeSort` function with unit tests.
